# Project Proposal Description

#### What is The Purpose of Your Research Project?
The purpose of this project is to find the correlation between the different COVID-19 variants and its impact on the population. To do this we will be looking at a variety of metrics from deaths to case number and even trying to find impact to the hospital systems. With the largest scope of the project looking at variant data, to narrow that focus we will be focusing more so on the variants of Delta and Omicron with the spikes of those two variants impacting the general population.

#### What other research has been done in this area?
1. [Omicron vs Delta](https://www.kaggle.com/francescovattiato/omicron-vs-delta)
This is a python notebook comparing Omicron and Delta, especially when it comes to how quickly each strain becomes dominant, the spread across time, and more. From the data, it looks like Omicron is becoming the dominant strain across different countries in a similar way to delta when it was first introduced.

2. [COVID-19 Variants Worldwide Evolution](https://www.kaggle.com/gpreda/covid19-variants)
This is a dataset that looks into different covid variants across the world, from more well-known ones like delta and omicron to less well-known ones like Iota and Mu. This could be useful in comparing the lesser-known COVID variants to show the scale of Delta and Omicron.

3. [Coronavirus Variants: Facts About Omicron, Delta and Other COVID-19 Mutants](https://www.livescience.com/coronavirus-variants.html)
This is an article reviewing the different covid variants, why they are more dangerous or contagious than the original strain, and which vaccines protect against them, and to what degree.

4. [CDC COVID Data Tracker](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#datatracker-home)
CDCs covid-19 data tracker dashboard with visualizations depicting cases, deaths, vaccination rate and community transmissions in the United States.

5. [Share of SARS-CoV-2 Sequences That Are The Delta Variant, Nov 29, 2021](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/covid-cases-delta?tab=map&time=2021-11-29&country=FRA~ZAF~GBR~ESP~BWA~AUS~USA~BEL~DEU~CAN~ITA)
This looks at a country by country case count percentage of the delta variant in each country. It compares various countries to find the peak of the variant's onset and allows the user to find information regarding when that respective country had its highest breakout of the delta variant.

6. [Share of SARS-CoV-2 Sequences That Are The Omicron Variant, Sep 20, 2021 to Feb 2, 2022](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/covid-cases-omicron?tab=chart&country=GBR~FRA~BEL~DEU~ITA~ESP~USA~ZAF~BWA~AUS)
This looks at a country by country case count percentage of the omicron variant in each country. It compares various countries to find the peak of the variant's onset and allows the user to find information regarding when that respective country had its highest breakout of the omicron variant.

#### What is the dataset you'll be working with?
1. [Omicron Daily Cases by Country (COVID-19 Variant)](https://www.kaggle.com/yamqwe/omicron-covid19-variant-daily-cases/tasks)
This dataset tracks the daily progression of the different variants (i.e. Delta and Omicron) by the percentage of case and the date. 

2. [Worldwide Omicron Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/mdjafrilalamshihab/worldwide-omicron-dataset)
This is another dataset that collects the percent increase of Omicron cases in different countries between September 19th, 2021 and January 4th, 2022. 

#### Who is your target audience?
Our target audience is the general public who understand how to analyze datasets and want to learn more about covid-19 and the impact of covid-19 variants.

#### What should your audience learn from your resource?
The audience should be able to grasp the full impact and scope of how each variant has come and impacted the given population, looking at case rates and overall impact metrics like death, among others. Overall this project will answer when the variants occurred? How each variant's peak differed from one another? With that the audience will be able to get a full understanding of each wave of COVID and a breakdown on the different variants and the overall effects of each.

# Technical Description

#### What will be the format of your final product?
Our final product will be a Shiny app web page.

#### Do you anticipate any specific data collection / data management challenges?
We believe that due to the differences in Covid and Covid variant data, we may have challenges manipulating the information and combining the csv files. This will include selecting which columns are relevant and which information needs to be filtered out. 

#### What new technical skills will you need to learn in order to complete your project?
We will have to learn some amount of formatting to ensure our end product has a good user interface.

#### What major challenges do you anticipate? 
One major challenge that we will have is to aggregate and manipulate the multiple data sets surrounding Covid-19 and Covid-19 variants. Due to the variety of sources and the differences between datasets, we may have to adjust the datasets to match our intended purpose.
